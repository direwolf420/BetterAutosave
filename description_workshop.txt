Better Autosave - Customize the autosave interval in both single and/or multiplayer!

[b]This mod can be installed on both servers and clients independently, comes with two configs:[/b]
* Server + Singleplayer
* Multiplayer Client
They let you customize the autosave interval (Default 10 minutes in singleplayer for world+player, and 5 minutes for player on the client) and also specify one for the server's world! (Vanilla only autosaves once an ingame day)

Read the homepage for more info.

[b]Notes:[/b]
* Only in singleplayer: Requires the "Autosave" setting in the game settings to be turned on
* The serversided world saving once an ingame day will still happen regardless
* Minimum interval is 10 seconds for stability reasons
